## Overview
Volatiles are a critical component of magmas, driving volcanic eruptions, creating and modifying planetary atmospheres, and generating ore deposits. Over the last few decades, there has been an immense amount of work quantifying the solubility of individual volatile species in a wide variety of magma compositions and the creation of various modelling capabilities to look at melt-vapor chemical equilibria of C-H-S-N-Cl-bearing magmas (e.g., pressure of vapour-saturation and degassing calculations). At IAVCEI2023, the first "Modelling volatile behaviour in magmas" workshop brought together experimentalists, numerical modellers, and observational researchers with an interest in volatile solubility in magmas to explore the current landscape and look for future directions. At Goldschmidt2026 we will host a follow-on workshop, supported by a Catalyst:Seeding grant from the Royal Society Te Apārangi (Aotearoa New Zealand).

There is wide variety of tools currently available to the community for modelling melt-vapor chemical equilibria, such as VESIcal, D-Compress, Sulfur_X, MAGEC, EVo, CHOSETTO, MELTS+DEW, and VolFe. This workshop will showcase some of these currently available tools with the opportunity to learn how to run calculations and compare calculation outputs. We will also present a benchmarking exercise, where different melt-vapor chemical equilibria tools have run the same degassing calculations, and explore the different behaviour of the tools (e.g., depth of sulfur degassing, changes in oxygen fugacity during ascent, melt and vapor composition, etc.). We will have discussions on future directions, outlining the progress on "what are the experimental and modelling gaps?", "what do observational researchers need these codes to do?", and "can we link monitoring needs to solubility outputs?" and discussing new topics to support future work to improve these tools.

Whether you're just getting started with modelling the behaviour of volatiles in magmas, or have used a variety of these tools in your own work, we are excited to see you at our workshop!.
